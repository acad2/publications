\beginsong{Lark in the Morning}
\begin{chorus}
The\[C] lark in the morning she a[G]rises from her\[Em] nest
And she ascends[Am] all in the air with the dew\[G] upon her\[Am] breast
And \[Am]with the pretty ploughboy she'll\[G] whistle and she'll\[Em] sing
And at night\[Am] she'll return to her own\[G] nest a[Am]gain
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
When his day's work is over, oh what then will he do
Perhaps then into some country wake he'll go
And with his pretty sweetheart, he'll dance and he'll sing
And at night he'll return with his love back again
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
And as they returned from the wake unto the town
The meadows they are mowed and the grass it is cut down
The nightingale she whistles upon the hawthorn spray
And the moon it is a shining upon the new mown hay
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Good luck unto the ploughboys wherever they may be
They will take a winsome lass for to sit upon their knee
And with a jug of beer boys, they'll whistle and they'll sing
And the ploughboy is as happy as a prince or a king
\end{verse}
