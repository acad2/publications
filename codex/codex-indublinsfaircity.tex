\beginsong{In Dublin's Fair City}
\beginverse
In dublin's fair city, where girls are so pretty
I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone
She wheeled a wheel-barrow, through streets broad and narrow
Crying: cockles and Mussels a-live, a-live oh
\endverse

\beginchorus
Alive, a-live oh, a-live a-live oh
Crying,. cockles and mussels a-live, a-live oh
\endchorus

\beginverse
She was a fishmonger, and sure 'twas no wonder
For so were her father and mother before
And they both wheeled their barrow,
through streets broad and narrow
Crying: cockles and Mussels a-live, a-live oh
\endverse

\beginverse
She died of a fever, and no one could save her
And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone
But her ghost wheels her barrow,
through streets broad and narrow
Crying: cockles and Mussels a-live, a-live oh
\endverse
\endsong
