\beginsong{Loch Lomon}

\beginverse
By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes,
Where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomon'
Where me and my true love were ever wont to be
On the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomon'.
\endverse

\beginchorus
O you’ll take the high road, and I’ll take the low road,
And I’ll be in Scotland before you
But me and my true love will never meet again
On the bonnie, bonnie banks o’ Loch Lomond.
\endchorus

\beginverse
I mind where we parted in yon shady glen
On the steep, steep side of Ben Lomond.
Where in deep purple hue, the Highland hills we view
And the moon comin’ out in the gloaming.
\endverse

\beginverse
The wee birdies sing and the wild flowers spring
And in sunshine the waters are sleeping
But the broken heart will ken no second spring again
And the world does not know how we're greeting. 
\endverse
