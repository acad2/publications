\beginsong{Yankee Doodle Dandy}
\beginverse
Yankee Doodle came to town
Upon a little pony.
He stuck a feather in his cap
And called it Macaroni.
\endverse

\beginchorus
Yankee Doodle, doodle doo
Yankee Doodle dandy.
All the lasses are so smart,
And sweet as sugar candy
\endchorus

\beginverse
Yankee Doodle is a tune,
It sounds so mighty handy.
All the enemies run away
At Yankee Doodle Dandy.
