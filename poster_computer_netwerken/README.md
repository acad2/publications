Poster Computer Netwerken
=========================
A poster on computer networks in Dutch based on the *KU Leuven* course by prof. dr. C. Huyghens.

Building
--------
One can build the poster by calling the make command:
```
make
```
Building the poster requires `pdflatex` and `qrencode`. One better installs `texlive-full` as well (since
the poster requires some packages).

`make upload` is only used by the author to upload the poster to a webserver (and can only be uploaded using private ssh-keys).
