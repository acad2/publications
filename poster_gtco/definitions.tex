vexcol/grcl/4/2.5/7 cm/{vertex-coloring}/{$\funsig{f_G}{V_G}{C}$}/{A \emph{vertex-coloring} for a graph $G$ is a mapping $\funsig{f}{V_G}{C}$ from its vertex-set to a set $C$ whose elements are called \emph{colors}. Typically, the colors are represented by positive integers. Given a vertex-coloring of $G$ the subset $V_c\subseteq V_G$ containing all vertices for a given color $c$ is called a \emph{color class}. An assignment of colors to a proper subset of $V_G$ is called a \emph{partial coloring}. For a partial coloring $f$ the \emph{color degree} of a vertex $v\in V_G$ denoted $\fun{\gamma_f}{v}$ is the number of different colors used by the neighbors of $v$ that have been assigned a color. If $C=\accl{1,2,\ldots,k}$, the mapping is called a \emph{$k$-coloring}. An vertex-coloring is \emph{proper} if two adjacent vertices are assigned different colors. If there exists a proper $k$-coloring for a graph $G$, the graph is said to be \emph{(vertex) $k$-colorable}.\frml{\fsat{\sumdomain[j]{C}{x_{i\,j}}=1&i\in V_G\\&x_{u\,j}+x_{v\,j}\leq 1&\tupl{u,v}\in E_G,j\in C\\&x_{i\,j}\in\accl{0,1}&i\in V_G,j\in C}}},
