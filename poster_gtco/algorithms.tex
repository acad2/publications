cpm/cop/31.5/7/9 cm/{Critical path method}/{CPM}/{The \emph{critical path method} is an algorithm that can determine the \emph{scheduling time} and \emph{slack time} of each activity in a project using an \emph{activity-on-arc network}. The method works in a \emph{forward phase} and \emph{backward phase}. In the forward phase the start vertex is labeled with $0$. Other vertices are labeled if all incoming arcs originate from labeled vertices with the maximum of the label of the starting vertex plus the weight of the edge. In the backward phase, the final vertex is co-labeled with its label. Then each vertex is labeled with the minimum over all outgoing edges of the head's co-label minus the weight of the edge.},
huffman/cseq/12/2.5/7 cm/{Huffman's algorithm}/{Huffman}/{\emph{Huffman's algorithm} is an algorithm that takes as input a set of symbols with the relative frequency of the symbols and constructs a binary tree whose corresponding prefix code has the smallest possible average weighted length.\paragraph{}The algorithm uses a priority queue where initially the symbols are placed ordered in increasing probability. At each iteration, the items in the priority queue with the smallest probability are grouped together in a node with as probability the sum of the two items. This binary tree is placed back in the queue and so inductively a binary tree is constructed.\importalgorithmiccenter{huffman}},

hungarian/cop/56.25/2/7 cm/{Hungarian algorithm}/{Hungarian}/{The \emph{Hungarian algorithm} solves the assignment problem optimally. At each iteration, the algorithm subtracts the minimum from a row or column of the cost matrix until there are $n$ independent zeros in the matrix. The assignment is then $x_{i\,j}=1$ for each of the independent zeros.},
fordfulk/maflw/14.25/1.5/9 cm/{Ford-Fulkerson algorithm}/{Ford-Fulkerson}/{The \emph{Ford-Fulkerson algorithm} solves the maximum flow problem to optimality. The algorithm incrementally searches for a path with available capacity (called an \emph{augmenting path}) and adds the available capacity to that path. How such path is constructed is not part of the algorithm. The \emph{Edmonds-Karp algorithm} does this using \emph{breadth-first search} on the graph.\importalgorithmiccenter{edmondskarp}}
