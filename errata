p 24: second definition should be A_{v,e} instead of A_{v,a}
p 31: verrtices -> vertices
p 35: x\in R^{|E|} naar x\in B^{|E|}?
p 38: the claim that the *speed* doubles every two years is false. From a theoretical point of view, the speed can only increase with sqrt(2) each year if the number of transistors double.
p 39: travelling -> traveling
