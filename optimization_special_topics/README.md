Optimization: Special Topics
============================
A modified version of the course *Optimization: Special Topics* by *prof. Spieksma*.

What and Why?
-------------

The modified course aims to be more rigorous and use a more mathematically correct syntax to denote terms.

Furthermore we've added an index at the back of the publication and vectorized the images.

The document is typesetted more compact and in a more definition-theorem-like way.

We aim to add some solutions to the exercises at the back of each chapter.

The text is edited by *Jo Devriendt* and *Willem Van Onsem*.
