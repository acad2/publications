Glossary Comparative Programming Languages
==========================================
A glossary containing several definitions relevant to the *Comparative Programming Languages* course at *KU Leuven*

Building
--------
One can build the glossary by calling the make command:
```
make
```
Building the glossary requires `pdflatex`. One better installs `texlive-full` as well (since the poster requires some packages).

`make upload` is only used by the author to upload the poster to a webserver (and can only be uploaded using private ssh-keys).
