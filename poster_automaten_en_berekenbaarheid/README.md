Poster Automaten en Berekenbaarheid
===================================
A poster on automata and computability in Dutch based on the *KU Leuven* course of *prof. dr. B. Demoen*.

Building
--------
One can build the poster by calling the make command:

```
make
```

Building the poster requires `pdflatex` and `qrencode`. One better installs `texlive-full` as well (since
the poster requires some packages).

It is possible that the poster cannot be generated on a Windows system since that operating system uses `\r\n` to denote a newline.

`make upload` is only used by the author to upload the poster to a webserver (and can only be uploaded using private ssh-keys).

Contributors
------------

We thank *Bart Demoen*, *Jon Sneyers* and *Jo Devriendt* for constructive comments to improve this poster. One can make his/her own contribution by opening an issue at the [github](github.com/KommuSoft/publications) repository.
