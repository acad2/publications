\chapter*{Preface}
These notes are lecture notes used for the course ``Optimization: special topics''. Its subject is mainly \concept{combinatorial optimization} with an emphasis on modeling issues and solution strategies. Its audience is students, more specifically: master students in engineering or management or economic programs.

\paragraph{}
The course assumes that the reader has had a first introduction to operations research and has some elementary knowledge of mathematical modeling, linear programming, and graph theory.

\paragraph{}
There are some excellent textbooks on combinatorial optimization. We mention Schrijver's trilogy: ``Combinatorial Optimization. Polyhedra and Efficiency'' \cite{schrijver-book}. Another example is: ``Combinatorial optimization'' by Cook, Cunningham, Pulleyblank, and Schrijver \cite{Cook:98}. Other related textbooks are: Nemhauser and Wolsey \cite{citeulike:2212037}, Wolsey \cite{wolseyip}.

Please notice that \chpref{complexity} is written by Prof. Yves Crama.
