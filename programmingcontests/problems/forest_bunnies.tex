\pprob[forest_bunnies][ieeextreme6]{Forest bunnies}
{In a forest, there were $x$ bunnies, $50\%$ male, and $50\%$ female, all adults. Bunnies doubles every $15$~days, $10\%$ of the baby rabbits dies at birth. They mature after $30$~days, $30\%$ leave the forest, and rest becomes rabbits. In every $30$~days, $25\%$ dies off due to flu. If every bunny dies off, the bunny world ends.}
{Calculate the final number of bunnies alive after $1$~year for any number of initial bunnies, $x$. \note{Please note that percentages are truncated}}
