\pprob{Honeycomb}
{Ron, the ant, got stuck in a honeycomb. He needs to get out of the honeycomb world.}
{We know the starting location and the exit point in the honeycomb as $x,y$ coordinates. Need to get the minimum distance, the ant has to traverse to get out of the honeycomb, through the edges. maximum size of the bee hive is limited to $12\times 12$. Each edge is $5~\mbox{mm}$. Input is taken in a format of $x_1.y_1,x_2.y_2$ from standard input and output is expected, the minimum distance to be traveled, as a integer value, in $\mbox{mm}$. Please check out the above image for more details.}
