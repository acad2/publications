\section{Coordinate systems}
Coordinates are used to map items in space. For most problems, the coordinates are discrete and orthogonal. For some problems however, it is useful to use different coordinate systems. We give an overview of some popular coordinate systems as well as ways to convert one system into another.
\subsection{Hexagonal coordinate system}
\importtikzfigure{hexagonalcoord}{Structure of hexagonal coordinates.}
A hexagonal coordinate system as depicted on \figref{hexagonalcoord} consists of three types of objects: \terms{center}, \terms{corner} and \terms{edge}. The centers are denoted with red dots, the corners with black dots and the edges with blue lines. The red lines denote the spokes of the centers.
