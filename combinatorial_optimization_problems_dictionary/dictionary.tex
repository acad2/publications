\dey[Maximum satisfiability]{Maximum satisfiability}{In the maximum satisfiability problem, one is given a set of boolean functions $\phi_1,\phi_2,\ldots,\phi_n$ defined on the set of boolean variables
 $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n$. One aims to find the boolean configuration $\vec{x}$ such that the maximum number of boolean functions is satisfied.}
\dey[knapsack]{Knapsack}{The knapsack problem is a group of different problems. In each problem, one is given a sequence of items $x_i$. Each item has one or more weights $w_i$ and some kind of utility value\footnote{Sometimes this value depends on other objects in the bag.} $v_i$. The objective is to generate a bag of objects such that the total utility is maximized under one or more weight bounds $W$. The number of weight constraints is called the \nmn{dimension} of the problem.}[0-1 knapsack,bounded knapsack,unbounded knapsack]
\dey[0-1 knapsack]{0-1 knapsack}{A special form of the \rey{knapsack} problem. In this variant, a bag contains zero or one instances of every item, in other words no copies of the specified items are allowed.}
\dey[bounded knapsack]{Bounded knapsack}{A special case of the \rey{knapsack} problem. In this variant, each item $x_i$ can has a bounded number of instances (specified by $c_i$).}
\dey[unbounded knapsack]{Unbounded knapsack}{A special case of the \rey{knapsack} problem. In this variant each item $x_i$ can have an unlimited number of instances in the bag.}
